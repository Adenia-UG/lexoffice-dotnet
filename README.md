# LexOffice .NET
An easy to use .NET wrapper for the LexOffice Public API. No fiddling with JSON or HTTP, it's all been done for you.

## Installation

`nuget install lexoffice-dotnet`

or just use the NuGet package browser search inside Visual Studio :)

## Getting Started

One line is all that is needed to get you going:

```csharp
LexOfficeApi api = new LexOfficeApi("your-Api-Key");
```

The `LexOfficeApi` Class is exposing all the endpoints. So you can do all the stuff from the LexOffice documentation. For example:

## Project Progress

[DONE] Invoices Endpoint
[DONE] VoucherList Endpoint
[In Progress] Code documentation
[TBD] Supporting Async
[TBD] Advanced error handling
[TBD] Contacts Endpoint
[TBD] Credit Notes Endpoint
[TBD] Event Subscription Endpoint
[TBD] Files Endpoint
[TBD] Order Confirmation Endpoint
[TBD] Profile Endpoint
[TBD] Quotations Endpoint
[TBD] Reading the lower rest of the LexOffice doc ;)
